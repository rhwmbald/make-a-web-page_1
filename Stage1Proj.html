          <p>
            When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

            HTML, <em>Hypertext Markup Language,</em> documents form the majority of the content on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>CSS</em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a> gives a good overview

            HTML documents are made of HTML <em>elements</em>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <em>tags</em>.

          Why Computers are Literal - Not Stupid

          <p>
            Computers do only what they are told because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you need to be a better programmer because <span class="c_green">Garbage in = Garbage out</span>.

        <div class="sum_detail">
          <p>
            HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

              There are HTML editors and CSS editors. The Documenation Object Mode (DOM) knows what to do with elements to translate them properly.

            <p>
              The <span class="c_green"> "tree-like structure" </span> comes from the fact that HTML elements can branch off. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.

          <div class="sum_detail">
            <p>
              When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

              When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier.

              Repetition reduction is effecient and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repetition wastes alot of time and can cause many mistakes. If a change is need later, it is easier. Only a single place will need to be changed instead of hundreds. Therefore, less support is needed which makes easier and faster to maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Standardization can be had by using the class in different parts of a web page. One style will control them all.

              CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, allow control of the style of related HTML elements. By using a class code in similar elements, they will all have the same font, color, size, ect.
